Game overview - Player controls a green square using WASD to move and arrow keys to aim. - SPACE shoots bullets; both player and enemy have 3 HP. - The room contains simple cross-shaped walls, so both sides need to navigate around obstacles. - When HP reaches 0, the round ends and can be restarted with R.
